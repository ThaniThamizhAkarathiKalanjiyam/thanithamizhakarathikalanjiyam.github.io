[*Order Attached*](/assets/pdf/DVMC_canot_invoke_every_person.pdf)

*It is not every person who can invoke the jurisdiction of the Court under
the 2005 Act, simply for claiming maintenance,*as the purpose of the
enactment is to protect rights of women who are victims of violence of any
kind occurring within the family, the court said. The Bombay High Court has
observed that the provisions of *Domestic Violence Act cannot be invoked
simply for claiming maintenance unless the party alleges*an act of
domestic violence and approach the court in the capacity as an*“aggrieved
person”*.

The family court, in this case, directed the husband to pay maintenance of
Rs.2 lakh to the wife under Section 20 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The husband moved the high court challenging
the said order. Justice Bharati H Dangre perused the application filed by
the wife and observed that apart from making the allegations that the
husband is well-off and earning a huge amount and the wife is left with no
source of livelihood, not a single averment has been made as to any act of
domestic violence.

*Only ‘Aggrieved Person’ can invoke*

The bench observed that the reliefs contemplated under the Domestic
Violence Act were available to an aggrieved person who alleges that she is
or has been in domestic relationship with the respondent and was subjected
to any act of domestic violence by the respondent. Allegation about the
commission of a Domestic Violence Act is prerequisite for the magistrate or
Court of competent jurisdiction to exercise the powers under the Protection
from Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and grant of any reliefs
contemplated under the Act, the court said agreeing with the submission
that that the provisions of DV Act cannot be invoked unless the party
alleges an act of domestic violence and approach the court in the capacity
as an *"aggrieved person".*Terming the family court order as ‘grossly
erroneous’, the court further observed: “Though the Family Court in the
impugned order has noted the submissions advanced on behalf of the
petitioner-husband that the preliminary requirement of the domestic
violence has not been proved by the petitioner and therefore application is
not maintainable, the Family Court did not pay any heed to the said
submission and rather proceeded to decide the matter on its own merits. The
Court has merely noted that as per provision of Section-20 of the D.V. Act
aggrieved by had claimed monetary relief for herself and her children
however, a whether the applicant is an "aggrieved person" has not at all
been considered by the Family Court. Though the Act of Domestic Violence
would be established after rendering evidence before the Court, at least
the Court prima facie must be satisfied that the person approaching is as
an "aggrieved person". It is not every person who can invoke the
jurisdiction of the Court under the 2005 Act, simply for claiming
maintenance, as the purpose of the enactment is to protect rights of women
who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family.” *The
court finally remanded the matter to family court for it to decide the
entitlement of maintenance of the wife under Section 20 of the Domestic
Violence Act.*

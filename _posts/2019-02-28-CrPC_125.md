62\. This reasoning of the learned Chief Justice appeals to us.

We are concerned with the Code which is complete on the topic and any defence against and order passed under section 125 Cr.P.C. must be founded on a provision in the Code. Section 125 CrPC is a provisionto protect the weaker of the two parties, namely, the neglected wife. If an order for maintenance has been made against the deserter it will operate until vacated or altered in terms of the provisions of the Code itself. If the husband has a case under Section 125 (4) (5) or section 127 of the Code it is open to him to initiate appropriate proceedings.  But until the original order for maintenance is modified or cancelled by a higher Court or is varied or vacated in terms of section 125 (4) or (5) or section 127, its validity survives. It is enforceable and no plea that there has been cohabitation in interregnum or that there has been a compromise between the parties can hold good as a valid defence.
